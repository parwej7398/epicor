            What do Super Bowl LVI, Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee, and The
            Cheesecake Factory have in common? Audiotonix.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            A pioneering market leader, Audiotonix designs, engineers and
            manufactures professional audio mixing consoles and ancillary
            products for use in live sound, broadcast, theatre production, house
            of worship, film production, music creation and recording studios.
            With nine brands—and growing—the company needed a single 360-degree
            view of the business to eliminate siloed systems, improve visibility
            and control, and drive efficiencies. Epicor Kinetic deployed in the
            cloud answered the call.
          </p>
          <p className="text-3xl">Consolidated Visibility</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            The largest provider of audio mixing consoles and accessories in the
            world today, Audiotonix is comprised of an expanding roster of
            award-winning brands covering a range of professional audio markets.
            With each new acquisition, it became more challenging to establish a
            single source of truth for the entire business.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            “The principal driver for us was to have all our data in one place,”
            explained Gerry Finnon, Business Systems/ERP Manager at Audiotonix.
            He continued, “We needed the visibility across the business and the
            ability to speed up month-end close.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Each of the Audiotonix brands ran on their own legacy ERP system,
            and several had different, separate financial systems. As a result,
            each business financial controller produced spreadsheets from their
            own system and delivered it to group management. That team would
            then consolidate the spreadsheets. Finnon shared, “As part of our
            Epicor journey, we developed a new chart of accounts across the
            group and as each company migrates onto Epicor, they also adopt
            account organization structure. The end result is better financial
            visibility from a single core data set and a much faster month-end
            close.” Today, three Audiotonix brands have migrated to Epicor with
            the remainder on track to be on-boarded by 2025. Finnon predicted,
            “As more of our businesses move online with Epicor Financial
            Planning & Analysis (FP&A), it is an essential tool to ensure an
            accurate, speedy financial close and consolidated management
            reporting.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Another benefit of a single source of data is a greatly improved
            insight into R&D ROI. Finnon elaborated, “Audiotonix is a research
            and development-led organization. We have roughly as many people in
            R&D as are in production and sales, which is reflected in our
            relentless innovation. And we are always looking to measure the
            return on those investments. Epicor gives us the power to do that.”

            The discipline that comes with using a mature ERP solution creates
            better processes and greater accuracy.

          <hr />
          <p className="text-lg">
            Epicor Kinetic also helps to enable real-time inventory management.
            “One manufacturing site had been heavily driven by backflushing
            processes, often dating inventory based on production quantities and
            creating a constant reset of the stock quantity,” Finnon
            highlighted. “We introduced Epicor Mobile Warehouse and now
            everything is in one system. Every pick goes on the handheld device,
            forcing a physical process. Not only has it given us a much better
            grasp on real-time inventory accuracy, but it has also created a
            cultural change that nothing leaves the shop unless it goes through
            Epicor.” Epicor has also enforced better processes, Audiotonix teams
            that are on Epicor are now cycle counting. Finnon acknowledged, “The
            discipline that comes with using a mature ERP solution creates
            better processes and greater accuracy.”

          <p className="text-3xl">Sound Return on Investment</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            In addition to Epicor Mobile Warehouse, Audiotonix has adopted
            several modules to extend and enhance the benefits of Epicor Kinetic
            deployed in the cloud.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            For instance, Epicor Data Analytics (EDA) has been deployed for
            sales and operational information. Finnon’s team utilizes the
            capability to create a real-time copy of the Audiotonix database and
            extract data in whatever form the business needs and feed it into
            the analytics tool. Finnon revealed, “EDA allows our sales teams to
            access data and to very quickly and easily sort or restrict data by
            brand. We can build a single model and then identify who can see
            which brand. This enabled us to take ownership of all our data
            models and manage them in a remarkably simple and seamless way.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            “We have become self-sufficient and in control of our data. If
            someone asks for a certain view, we can quickly and efficiently
            drill down on KPIs and deliver exactly what is needed.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Another example is Epicor Enterprise Content Management (Epicor
            ECM), which gives the business the ability to store documents such
            as shipping notes, terms and conditions, and customer-facing
            materials in the system. “Epicor ECM has accelerated our initiative
            to reduce or eliminate paper trails and given us a single
            repository,” said Finnon. He cited one example: “Every machine runs
            on a test bed before shipping, which provides diagnostic
            information. With Epicor ECM, those test files are attached to the
            serial number of the product so if there is ever a support issue,
            our service engineers can easily access the initial factory
            diagnostics.”
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="text-xl font-semibold italic text-blue-900">
            Simply being in the cloud, and on an Azure cloud in particular,
            offers many sustainability gains . . . Plus, having Epicor in the
            cloud keeps us current on features and capabilities, as well as
            areas such as governance and security which are continuously
            changing.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p className="text-lg">
            The next module slated to on-board is Epicor Automation Studio, to
            be integrated with Zendesk. Today, customer support is managed with
            Zendesk. If a customer reports a problem, a ticket is raised in
            Zendesk and if a replacement or RMA is needed, the information needs
            to be duplicated in Epicor. “With Epicor Automation Studio, Zendesk
            and Epicor will speak to each other, eliminating the need for
            duplicate data entry,” Finnon explained.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            He continued, “We see a lot of other potential benefits with Epicor
            Automation Studio. For instance, we receive a high volume of
            products from offshore contract manufacturers, thousands of pieces,
            each with their own serial number. Today, it’s a manual process to
            get those numbers into the system. Epicor Automation Studio will
            automate that process and save many man-hours.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            This frees Audiotonix employees to spend more time to focus on
            addressing customer needs and give customers a much smoother
            after-sales experience.
          </p>
          <p className="text-3xl">Cloud Wins</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Above and beyond the advantages that Epicor Kinetic helps to
            deliver, cloud deployment has generated additional benefits. A major
            one is supporting Audiotonix’s sustainability initiatives, a key
            focus for Audiotonix. As an example, Finnon cited that several of
            the company’s manufacturing facilities are equipped with solar
            panels, saving approximately 35% in energy consumption.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Finnon shared, “Simply being in the cloud, and on an Azure cloud in
            particular, offers many sustainability gains. We don’t need to run
            hardware on-site, eliminating all the overhead that accompanies an
            on-prem footprint.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            “Plus, having Epicor in the cloud keeps us current on features and
            capabilities,” he added. “Running on current versions of any ERP
            system is always a good practice, purely because underlying
            technology, governance mandates and security credentials are
            continuously evolving. Having the latest version in the cloud really
            pushes us along.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Epicor Kinetic further allows harmony between standardized processes
            and agility to meet discrete business needs. Finnon elaborated, “At
            the outset we developed a blueprint of common processes for each of
            our businesses to follow within the constraints of the Epicor
            solution. However, they all present slightly different challenges
            and needs. As a toolset, Epicor Kinetic gives us the flexibility to
            tune to those specific needs.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            And, if the Audiotonix team ever runs into any issues, award-winning
            Epicor support is just a click or call away. “We're direct with
            Epicor from a support perspective and I have to say that the support
            is excellent. It's really good. The support system, EpiCare is also
            very good” Finnon said.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            He concluded, “At a recent user event, I was sharing how great it is
            that we don't really need to manage the system, test upgrades, or
            worry about infrastructure. It is a huge advantage.”
